				<p class="indent_title fade-in zero">
					My goal is to become a great software craftsman and build delightful and beautiful apps.<br />I’m currently working on my own open source projects and I also like contributing to other people’s projects as well. I usually attend as many meetups as I can about Android and software development. Recently I gave a talk about UI testing on Android using Espresso at Droidcon Spain 2013 and Droidcon Italy 2014.

					2008 – Unfinished: <span style="color:/*hover_green*/#669902">Computer Science</span> (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona)
				</p>
				<p class="indent fade-in one">
					I studied a degree in Computer Science in UAB, I couldn’t complete the degree because of some free elective credits missing. During my degree I started working part-time and then full time so I didn’t have enough time to finish it. Then I moved to London, which makes it even more difficult for me to complete the remaining few credits.
