					My goal is to become a great and efficient mobile software developer.<br />I’m an active person. I always try to know what’s new in mobile development and try to go to events, tech talks and participate in Android online development groups as much as I can. Recently, I had the chance to take part of a hackathon to create apps that encourage people to recycle more in Barcelona and won the second prize.
