							My name is Xavi Rigau, I'm 23 and I live near Barcelona, Spain. I studied Computer Science (well, I haven't finished yet, since I must finish some free elective credits). I enjoy coding. A lot. Specially for phone and tablet devices and I feel really passionate of what I do.

						<p class="fade-in three">
							I worked as Android Developer for more than 2 years, and then I had the chance to play around with the Android NDK, Mac OS X and BlackBerry 10 OS development. I've taken part of many projects, most of them are applications that can be found on Google Play.
